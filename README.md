# Journal_Prompts_Using_Vue_3

The aim here is for me to have a concrete project upon which I shall apply and hone my web development skill set.
In particular, this application should be excellent for prompting users for journal entries (which can be 
customized, and, hopefully, eventually shared as libraries for users to use; e.g. first date, mourning, e.t.c.)
